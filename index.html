            <h1>Burundi 2015 Unrest Aftermath</h1>
            <h3>CMPS 165 final project proposal</h3>
            <h4>Danny Boyd, Ryan Oliver, Winston Wu</h4>
            <p>After talking with the TAs, we have decided to try and tackle the Burundi data in a different manner. The <a target="blank" href="https://www.acleddata.com/dashboard/#108">Burundi data from ACLED</a> has several variables which we can use to make an interesting visualization:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Location (adm1/2/3, longitude, latitude)</li>
            	<li>Date (down to day)</li>
            	<li>Factions involved (actor 1, actor 2)</li>
            	<li>Fatalities</li>
            	<li>ACLEDâ€™s event type designations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We want to make a project which looks at how the conflicts occurred during the 2015 unrest, specifically which actor groups were involved and how often.</p>
            <p>To that end, we are interested in making a heat map of events which can be filtered by a particular actor. After discussing with Karthik, we think that this could be accomplished using a <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/Fil/eb0457ccaad00e65d21b80601c8a516e">hexbin</a>-style heatmap to group near points over the outlines of the burundi geojson data. A time slider will be utilized (likely per month, or over a range of months) to select a period of time for the heat map.</p>
            
            <p>Next to the map will be a multi-line graph (or similar chart) which shows conflicts/events over time where each line tracks the number of conflicts each actor participated in. Check boxes can be to toggle on/off the various actors. It may be possible to put fatalities/events overlayed.</p>
            
            <p>As a hex cell (or province, commune?) is selected, the multi-line chart will switch focus and redraw with data just occurring inside the region. An overlay will be used to show a list of the events which are currently filtered into the multi-line chart, along with various blurbs containing details about particular events.</p>
            
            <p>We think that this is an interesting story that we could tell. It also may be possible to retool this and aim it at a different armed conflict, if need be.</p>
