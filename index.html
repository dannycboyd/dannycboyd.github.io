            <h1>Internal Displacement in Post-2015 Burundi</h1>
            <h3>CMPS 165 final project proposal</h3>
            <h4>Danny Boyd</h4>
            <p>This project will aim to provide a clear and succinct look at numbers of internally displaced people in Burundi after the 2015 coup and following political unrest. This project will extend my Program 6, which did this for one snapshot in jan 2018. I'm curious in particular to see how the data changes as time progresses. My proposal then is a map, similar to my <a href="./burundi/index.html">Program 6</a>, but extended with a time slider so that the other reports will be visualized.</p>
            <p>The displacement reports, which are the bulk of the data for this project, will come from the <a href="http://www.globaldtm.info/burundi/">Displacement Tracking Matrix</a>, a project started by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). They have compiled comprehensive statistics on many aspects of the displacement. For example, here are some of the visualisations which the DTM has put together for 2017</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5kVYdvcMFtcakVDZ24yZFgyd2s">Burundi 2017 Dashboards</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ILcxsZYMkqzXoA68IGiSGs4XvyBh1qWk">Burundi 2018 Dashboards</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another visualization, not of displacement but of violent events is <a href="https://www.acleddata.com/dashboard/#108">this one</a>, assembled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). The data tracks the number of individual conflict events over time, the number and location of violent events as well as what type of violence it was, and the number of conflicts commited by various armed groups</p>
            <p>The United Nations Refugee Agency also has assembled a report on Burundi, which can be found <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/59244aa77.pdf">here</a>. Details include externally displaced people, as well as plans for strategy and coordination</p>
