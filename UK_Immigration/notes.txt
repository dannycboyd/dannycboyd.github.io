area chart
Make related regions related colors (South Asia, SE Asia, etc should all be shades of the same color)
Hand pick colors
Africa should not be the same color as Europe Other
Other should be a more muted color
Reorder the stacked area so that smaller values go on the bottom.
Maybe leave out other altogether
make the data yearly instead of quarterly.

Pie charts:
Tooltip too dark, make it lighter ("softer", he said)
Use the styling like below
Field   :   01
Fiels2  :   21
for the tooltip, so that everything is aligned
If you click on the pie chart, it could open up to show another pie chart of for the total # of immigrants, show me where they are from
Static labels on the outside of the current pie chart, which show the native born % and the foreign born %.

Stacked bar:
Other should be muted in color, go on top
Remove 2018 data, it's incomplete and misleading
Choose a better ordering for the bars
Visitor, short study should be less emphasized (muted, go on top?)
What is ?other?

Make sure the barchart colors don't overlap with the area colors.
Make sure the area colors _do_ match with the pie chart colors.
